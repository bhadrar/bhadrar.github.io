    <p> My extracurricular subjects are mainly focused on music. I participate in three kinds of voice, and play the piano and violin. </p>

          <li> I have participated in the Certificate of Merit (a musical evaluation test that includes technique, theory, and the performance of musical pieces from different eras) for piano since 3rd grade and I am now in level 6. Last year, I received Branch and State Honors for excellence in performance and evaluation. </li>
        </ul>  
      </li>

      <p> Overall, these extracurriculars have helped me in many ways to grow as a person. Because I have to regularly practice and take evaluations, playing these instruments and singing have really helped teach me the importance of time management. My extracurriculars have also taught me that if I work hard, I can reach my goals. In addition, they have taught me to never give up if I am struggling with learning a piece, and this applies to my everyday life too. In these aspects, having these extracurricular activites has helped build my character as a student and as a person. </p>
